# Packages/Libraries Used
* `Matplotlib.pyplot` - Visualizations including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, 3D visualizations, and more. Seamless integration with NumPy
* `NumPy` - Mathematical functions to operate on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.  Includes element-wise arithmetic, matrix multiplication, linear algebra operations, trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and special functions like Bessel functions and error functions.
* `Pandas` - Data analysis and manipulation
* `PyArrow` = Adds parquet conversion support to pandas
* `Python-Levenshtein` - Levenshtein distance string similarity functions
* `SciKit-learn` (sklearn) - Predictive data analysis tools
    * sklearn.`preprocessing` - Data standardizing, scaling, and label encoding (enum to 0/1)
    * sklearn.`model_selection.train_test_split` - Data spliting
* `SpaCy` - Tools for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and more
* `Seaborn` - Built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics. Seaborn provides a range of statistical visualizations, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and more. It also includes specialized visualizations for specific types of data, such as time series, categorical data, and distributions.
* `TheFuzz` - String comparison
    * thefuzz.`fuzz` - Match probability ratio function
* `Torch` (pytorch) - Deep learning, neural network, machine learning framework
    * torch.`nn` - Neural network layers and functions
    * torch.`optim` - Optimization algorithms
* `TorchText` - Simplifies the process of loading and preprocessing text data. Pretrained word models, tokenization, numericalization, and data splitting.
